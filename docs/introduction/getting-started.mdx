# Getting Started

**Welcome to Detox!**

In this guide, we will walk you through setting Detox up in your project, one step at a time.

You will find that some steps are longer than the others: some are just one-paragraph long, while for others we have a dedicated multistep guide worked out. Bear with us - it is all necessary, and once set-up, it is easy to move forward with writing tests very rapidly.

Please select type of your mobile application before you start the tutorial:

<Tabs groupId="appType">
    <TabItem value="start-rn" label="React Native" default />
    <TabItem value="start-expo" label="Expo">
        <IntroExpo />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="start-other" label="Other">
        <IntroOther />
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Setting up the environment

Your first step would be to complete the
[ðŸ“š React Native Environment Setup Guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/environment-setup).

<p>
    Open the link above and switch there to <b>React Native CLI Quickstart</b> tab to see
    the interactive tutorial for <b>Development OS</b> and <b>Target OS</b> of your choice.
</p>

<p>
    Follow all
    the steps <span style={{color: 'red'}}>(yes, even if you have a native app!)</span> and
    make sure you can create and run React Native apps on virtual testing devices.
</p>

## Installing Detox prerequisites

To complete the environment setup, you still have 2 steps ahead: installing `detox-cli` and `applesimutils`.

### 1. Command Line Tools (`detox-cli`)

`detox-cli` is merely a script that passes commands through to
a local Detox executable located at `node_modules/.bin/detox`,
making it easier to operate Detox from the command line, e.g. `detox test -c ios.sim.debug`.

It should be installed globally, enabling usage of the command line tools outside your npm scripts:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install detox-cli --global
```

On the other hand, if you are fine with running Detox commands with `npx detox ...`, you may skip installing `detox-cli`.

### 2. [MacOS Only] `applesimutils`

This tool is **required** by Detox to work with iOS simulators. The recommended way to install
[`applesimutils`](https://github.com/wix/AppleSimulatorUtils) is via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```bash
brew tap wix/brew
brew install applesimutils
```

:::info Note

Make sure to periodically update your version of `applesimutils` to the latest version.

## Setting up the project

<Tabs groupId="appType">
    <TabItem value="start-rn" label="React Native" default>
        Go to your project's root folder (where <code>package.json</code> is found) and run:
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="start-other" label="Native iOS">
        <p>Create a <code>package.json</code> in your project's root by running this command:</p>
        <CodeBlock language="bash">
            npm init -y
        </CodeBlock>
        <p>And remember to add the <code>node_modules</code> folder to your <code>.gitignore</code> file.</p>
        <p>Now you are ready to install the Detox itself. Run:</p>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install detox --save-dev
```

The next step would be to **install a test runner**. Out of the box, Detox offers you first-class integration
with [Jest](https://jestjs.io), and that is our official recommendation:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install "jest@>=27.2.5" --save-dev
```

:::info
The command above will install the **latest Jest version** regardless of the constraint, but `@>=27.2.5` is
recommended in the first place to prevent you from getting an incompatible Jest version unknowingly, under influence
of the existing lock files. Reportedly, `package-lock.json` could restrict `npm install jest` to installing
an older, unsupported version `26.x`.
:::

Now, when all the dependencies are installed, initialize Detox in your project:

```bash
detox init
```

Normally you should see an output like:

```plain text
Created a file at path: .detoxrc.js
Created a file at path: e2e/jest.config.js
Created a file at path: e2e/starter.test.js
```

:::tip
If you see a message like `command not found: detox`, make sure you have [installed Detox command line tools](#1-command-line-tools-detox-cli).

Now, when your environment and a boilerplate with configuration are ready, let's move to the next section,
[Building for Detox](building-with-detox.mdx).
