Find in your `.detoxrc.js` the `devices` section and replace blabla:

+ 42
</CodeBlock>

Following device types could be used to control Android devices:

- `android.emulator`. Boot stock Android-SDK emulator (AVD) with provided `name`, for example `Pixel_API_28`.

- `android.attached`. Connect to already-attached android device. The device should be listed in the output of `adb devices` command under provided `name`.
  The `avdName` property accepts a regular expression pattern that allows to specify the pool of device candidates to which you wish to connect. Use this property to run tests in parallel on multiple attached devices.

- `android.genycloud`. TODO
