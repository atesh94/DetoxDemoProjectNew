# Using Genymotion Cloud

As the number of your end-to-end tests grows, the overall test session duration might easily surpass an hour or two.
A good idea first would be to parallelize the test execution using your test runner (e.g. for Jest that
would be forwarding `--maxWorkers <N>`), but this approach has its limitations. An average build agent could manage
running a few virtual devices at once, but running a dozen devices at once would make it slow and unreliable.

So, if you're running into scaling issues, it's the right time to move on to SaaS platforms, where you can
start and stop devices on demand at any scale. At the moment, Detox can offer you a first-class integration with
[Genymotion Cloud], the platform that offers cloud-based Android Virtual Devices.
